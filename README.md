# Eclipse Paho MQTT D client library

This repository contains the source code for the [Eclipse Paho](http://eclipse.org/paho) MQTT D client library on memory managed operating systems such as Linux/Posix and Windows.

*Note that this library is currenly in an early incubation phase. Although the code is operational, the overall project is lacking in essentials such as a viable build system, proper documentation, and basic testing.*

This code builds a library which enables D applications to connect to an [MQTT](http://mqtt.org) broker to publish messages, and to subscribe to topics and receive published messages.

Currently only asynchronous modes of operation are supported.

This code requires the [Paho C library](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c) by Ian Craggs

## Building from source

The library uses the D lang build tool, DUB. It can be downloaded from the [DUB download page](https://code.dlang.org/download).

Simply clone the package repository and run `dub`.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.d.git
$ cd paho.mqtt.d
$ dub
```

## Example

Sample applications can be found in src/samples.

```
int main()
{
	const int QOS = 1;

	try {
		auto cli = new MqttAsyncClient("tcp://localhost:1883", "AsyncClient.d");

		if (!cli.isOK()) {
			writeln("Error creating client.");
			return 1;
		}

		writeln("Connecting...");
		auto connListener = new ConnListener;
		MqttToken tok = cli.connect(null, null, connListener);
		tok.waitForCompletion();
		writeln("...OK");

		writeln("Sending a message...");
		stdout.flush();
		MqttDeliveryToken dtok = cli.publish("hello", "Hello World", QOS, false);
		dtok.waitForCompletion();

		writeln("...OK\nSending another message...");
		auto msg = new MqttMessage("Hi There", QOS);
		dtok = cli.publish("hello", msg);
		dtok.waitForCompletion();

		writeln("...OK\nDisconnecting...");
		stdout.flush();
		tok = cli.disconnect();
		tok.waitForCompletion();
		writeln("OK\nDone");

		return 0;
	}
	catch (MqttException exc) {
		writeln("MQTT Error: ", exc.getReasonCode());
	}

	return 1;
}
```
