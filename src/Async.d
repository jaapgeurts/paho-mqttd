 * &copy; Copyright IBM Corp. 2009, 2015
 *
 * @brief An Asynchronous MQTT client library for C.
 *
 * An MQTT client application connects to MQTT-capable servers.
 * A typical client is responsible for collecting information from a telemetry
 * device and publishing the information to the server. It can also subscribe
 * to topics, receive messages, and use this information to control the
 * telemetry device.
 *
 * MQTT clients implement the published MQTT v3 protocol. You can write your own
 * API to the MQTT protocol using the programming language and platform of your
 * choice. This can be time-consuming and error-prone.
 *
 * To simplify writing MQTT client applications, this library encapsulates
 * the MQTT v3 protocol for you. Using this library enables a fully functional
 * MQTT client application to be written in a few lines of code.
 * The information presented here documents the API provided
 * by the Asynchronous MQTT Client library for C.
 *
 * <b>Using the client</b><br>
 * Applications that use the client library typically use a similar structure:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Create a client object</li>
 * <li>Set the options to connect to an MQTT server</li>
 * <li>Set up callback functions</li>
 * <li>Connect the client to an MQTT server</li>
 * <li>Subscribe to any topics the client needs to receive</li>
 * <li>Repeat until finished:</li>
 *     <ul>
 *     <li>Publish any messages the client needs to</li>
 *     <li>Handle any incoming messages</li>
 *     </ul>
 * <li>Disconnect the client</li>
 * <li>Free any memory being used by the client</li>
 * </ul>
 * Some simple examples are shown here:
 * <ul>
 * <li>@ref publish</li>
 * <li>@ref subscribe</li>
 * </ul>
 * Additional information about important concepts is provided here:
 * <ul>
 * <li>@ref async</li>
 * <li>@ref wildcard</li>
 * <li>@ref qos</li>
 * <li>@ref tracing</li>
 * </ul>
